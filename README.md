## Opening

#### What we are doing

In this lab, we will practice computational thinking by breaking down everyday activities into specific steps.

> ***Note:*** _This Lab is designed to be done independently._

#### Why we are doing it

Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving process that includes a number of characteristics and dispositions. CT is essential to the development of computer applications, but it can also be used to support problem-solving across all disciplines, including the humanities, math, and science. Students who learn CT throughout their curriculum can begin to see a relationship between academic subjects, as well as between life inside and outside of the classroom.

Computational thinking is what allows you to "Think in Code."

## Exercise

In these exercises, we will break down activities into a simple language called _pseudo english_.

For each exercise, explain the subject in three different levels of detail: **Low**, **Medium**, **High**.

**For example**

This is how to describe **"How to drive a car out of a garage"** in a series of steps:

> Instructor note: Get this in sublime text as `car_drive.txt`.

**High Level**

```
#1 > Drive the car out of the garage.
```

**Medium Level**

```
#1 > Find my car.
#2 > Get in the car.
#3 > Turn the car on.
#4 > Drive the car away.
```

**Low Level**

```
#1 > For every car in the garage.
    #2 > If car is my car, go to #4.
#3 > Can't find my car. Panic!ðŸ˜±
#4 > Walk to the car.
#5 > If the car is unlocked, go to #7.
#6 > Unlock the car.
#7 > Open the door.
#8 > Sit in the driver's seat.
#9 > Close the door.
#10 > If Tesla, smile, go to #13.
#11 > Put the key in the ignition.
#12 > Turn the key.
#13 > Buckle up.
#14 > If today is Friday, Honk two times.
(etc)
...
```

> ***Note:*** Use your judgement to determine how "Low" you want to go.

#### Requirements

You can either whiteboard these problems or write them out in a plain text (`.txt`) file or a Word document. It should look like the example above. 

Explain the steps involved in the following:

#### Basics
+ How do you type your name? `[High, Medium, Low]`
+ How do you turn on and unlock your iPhone? `[High, Medium, Low]`
+ How do you make coffee (or a cup of tea)? `[High, Medium, Low]`

> Instructor note: Come back after 10 minutes and review student solutions for 'unlock iPhone' and 'make coffee.' Whiteboard the results.


#### Traveling
+ How do you get to the airport? `[High, Medium]`
+ How do you get to class? `[High, Medium, Low]`

#### Activities
+ How do you get dressed? `[Medium]`
+ How do you buy groceries? `[High, Medium, Low]`
+ How do you make a sandwich? `[High, Medium, Low]`
+ How do you exercise? `[High, Medium]`

#### Decisions
+ How do you decide what shoes to buy? `[High, Medium]`
+ How do you decide what movie to watch? `[High, Medium, Low]`
+ How do you decide what to eat? `[High, Medium]`
+ How do you decide what to wear? `[High, Medium, Low]`

#### Think-pair-share 

What was the most eye-opening part of this exercise? What was the biggest lesson you'll carry throughout the course?



### Hungry for More?

#### Math
+ How do you add two numbers? `[High, Medium, Low]`
+ How do you determine if a number is Prime? `[Medium, Low]`
+ How do you compute Fibonacci to the 14th element? `[Medium, Low]`
